# Mapping_Earthquakes

An interactive map of earthquakes.

# Purpose:
 
The project aims to create an earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. To display the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates, show all the major earthquakes with a  greater magnitude of  4.5 or more on the map and show the data on a third map.
